## Description 
I'm remaking my portfolio!ü¶ù I've learned so much since week2, so let's use React and put everything to practice! I've also tried out some MUI for styling! My Portfolio is still raccoon themed, however this single page application looks like 4 now. I have pages for my About Me, Portfolio (which includes all my projects from GitHub), Contact section, and my Resume with a button to download it as well. Hope to land a job soon! I'm so excited!!
